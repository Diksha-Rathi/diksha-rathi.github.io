This blog post is about contributing to various projects on Github. After finding a project, one wishes to contribute to, it is a three step process. It can be summarised as-

> 1. Fork the repository.
> 2. Make the fix.
> 3. Submit a pull request to the project owner.

#### Step-1: Fork the repository 

* Navigate to the repository you wish to contribute to.
* On the top right corner click on fork. This is the third button from left in the image below.
