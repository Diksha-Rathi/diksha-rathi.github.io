Today, I focused more on identifying my weak areas and strengths to help me come up with a plan for this journey.

Apart from planning, I also practiced a few more questions from leetcode on Graphs and DFS. I moved from the standard connected component questions to more indirect questions on graph traversals. These felt more challenging than the standard problems that I had completed on Day 1.

A list of problems to refer under this category - 

1. [Friend Circles](https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-circles/)
2. [Keys and Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/)

Also, practiced a few more easy problems on the same connected components use case- 
1. [Flood Fill](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/)
2. [Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/)

An important part of interview feedback was around "Thinking out loud". I definitely couldn't agree more with the interviewer then. I felt that I was not able to put out my thoughts open while interviewing, even though everything was crisp and clear in my head.

So, today, I focused on whiteboarding my approach than coding the solution to questions. I hope this helps me out in putting my ideas out better during an interview next time.

Ending this one with the hope that I can push myself to write down and post my learnings for the day before I sleep, instead of waiting for the next morning!
